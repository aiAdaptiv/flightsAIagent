Rules of the search:

Always look for the cheapest flights and with max one stop if the flight is outside of Europe.

By default look for the two way flights including the return in including time from my {vacation_days}.

I can move my vacation 3 days earlier or later.

Never look for three first days of a month and three last days.

Always start from Warsaw Chopin Airport.
