I will provide you rules and vacation dates for finding the best flight offers. You need to focus on processing the rules and vacation dates and then provide me with the best flight offers. You should return flights in a json format, like this:

```json
{
  "flights": [
    {
      "departure": "Warsaw",
      "arrival": "Paris",
      "airlines": ["Airline1", "Airline2"],
      "price": 100,
      "start_date": "2025-04-05",
      "end_date": "2025-04-15"
    }
  ]
}
```
